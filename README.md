Full Sail Sit-in Mobile Device Deployment Class project


API is live online & configured in the sitins project.

There is no need to set up a local database or to run MAMP on the api folder.

Installed sendmail on ubuntu so the SMTP services are there and working.
All emails are sent to my email address currently.


I noticed that the mail response is taking a long time to reply to the app.
The sitins only add once I get a 200 back form the API. Since it's coming back slowly
it takes a while for the sitins list and number to update.
It IS working though. It may have been the sendmail SMTP service that slowed things down.
Email me if you have any questions.



Thanks again for everything, Chris & Rachel.
:)

Cheerio!
