==============

Full Sail Sit-in Mobile Device Deployment Class project


API is live online & configured in the sitins project.

There is no need to set up a local database or to run MAMP on the api folder.

Installed sendmail on ubuntu so the SMTP services are there and working.
All emails are sent to my email address currently.


Thanks again for everything, Chris & Rachel.
:)

Cheerio!
