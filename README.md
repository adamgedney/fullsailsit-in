Full Sail Sit-in Mobile Device Deployment Class project


Just a quick note:

Until I fix routing, run the api folder in MAMP on port :8887
& the app folder through grunt serve on the default port :9000.

Ideally, the api would live on a server or subdomain, but for local dev purposes
I mimic an external server by using MAMP.

Oh! Don't forget the database for the API.
grab the wfp_development_2014-02-13.sql file.
Import it into Sequel Pro then match the config in database.php in the api/config folder to your database settings.




Cheerio!
